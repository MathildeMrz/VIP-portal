<h1>FAQ and troubleshooting</h1>


<h2>Q: All my jobs are failing. What can I do?</h2>
A: open your simulation in simulation monitor and check the job minor status in tab "Jobs Summary"
<ul>
    <li>Minor status is "Application execution failed": the simulator didn't manage to process your data. Right-click on
        the job and check for error messages in the application output and error files.
    </li>
    <li>Minor status is "Input download failed": maybe the input file you specified doesn't exist. If it does, then it
        may be unavailable: contact us!
    </li>
    <li>Minor status is "Output upload failed": maybe there is a mistake in the output directory that you specified. If
        not, contact us!
    <li> Minor status is "Retrieving status": information about the job is not available yet.
</ul>

<h2>Q: Some jobs failed. Is it an issue?</h2>

the execution system (e.g. a file is not accessible from 1 computing site or the simulator doesn't work properly on 1
site); you should get your results.
If the error rate grows beyond 10% then check the previous answer.

access to group folders.

<h2>Q: I have a beginner account. How can I get an advanced one?</h2>
