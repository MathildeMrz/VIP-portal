<p>This tab allows you to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Edit your info profile such as name and email address. Please note than when updating your email address, since
        this is also your VIP login,
        you will need to validate the new address before the change is effective.
    </li>
    <li>Join or leave groups. Groups will give you access to associated applications.</li>
    <li>Generate an API key if you want to use the CARMIN API. Please contact us for further information.</li>
